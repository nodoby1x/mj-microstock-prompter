# Generative AI Configuration for High-Quality Adobe Stock Image Prompts

**Objective:** Generate detailed and effective prompts for Google's Imagen (3 & 4) to create images with high commercial value for Adobe Stock.

**Core Principles for Prompt Generation:**

1.  **Prioritize Commercial Viability:** The primary goal is to create images that businesses and designers will purchase. Focus on themes of authenticity, business, technology, wellness, and modern aesthetics.
2.  **Embrace Detail and Specificity:** Generate long-form, descriptive prompts. The more detail provided, the better Imagen can interpret the desired outcome.
3.  **Incorporate Photographic Principles:** Include commands for camera angles, lighting, and composition to ensure a professional and high-quality result.
4.  **Optimize for Adobe Stock Guidelines:** Prompts should lead to images that meet Adobe Stock's technical and content requirements (e.g., no logos, recognizable branding, or overly sensitive content).
5.  **Leverage Negative Prompts (Sparingly):** Use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements, ensuring a cleaner and more usable final image.

    > A photorealistic, high-resolution lifestyle photograph of a diverse group of young professionals in a modern, open-plan office. The composition is dynamic and asymmetrical, with a focus on a woman in the foreground presenting data on a transparent tablet. The lighting is bright and natural, coming from large floor-to-ceiling windows. The overall mood is collaborative and innovative. The color palette consists of neutral tones with pops of corporate blue and green.

* **Prompt 2 (Health/Wellness):**
    > A photorealistic, high-resolution still life photograph of a healthy meal preparation. The composition is a top-down flat lay on a white marble countertop. The focus is on a pair of hands tossing a vibrant quinoa salad in a ceramic bowl, with fresh ingredients like avocado, cherry tomatoes, and spinach scattered artfully around. The lighting is soft and even, resembling natural daylight. The mood is fresh, clean, and inspiring. The color palette is rich with natural greens, reds, and oranges.

* **Prompt 3 (Conceptual/Minimalist):**
    > A high-resolution 3D render of a single, glowing lightbulb suspended in the center of an otherwise empty, dark room. The composition is minimalist and centered, with significant copy space on all sides. The key detail is the intricate filament glowing brightly within the bulb. The lighting is dramatic, with the lightbulb being the sole light source, casting soft shadows. The mood is one of innovation, ideas, and clarity. The color palette is a simple contrast of warm yellow light and deep black.
