"""Minimal stub of the :mod:`openai` package for testing purposes.

The real OpenAI Python client is not installed in the execution environment
used for the tests.  Only a very small subset of its interface is required and
even that is patched by the unit tests.  Providing this stub allows ``import
openai`` to succeed without pulling in the actual dependency.
